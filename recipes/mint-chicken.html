        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <!-- add <li> for all these -->
            <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>½ cup margarine</li>
            <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <!-- add the li for these -->
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
            <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.</li>
        </ol>
